# 2020_primary_scenario_analysis [WORK IN PROGRESS]
This is an RShiny app to simulate the 2020 Democratic primary polls if/when candidates drop out.

I am using this project to explore RShiny and answer a question that has bothered me for the entire 2020 Democratic primary: 

How would the poll ranking of top candidates change if the tail candidates (<X% in polls) drop out?

I will answer this by using polls collected by fivethirtyeight (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/polls/README.md)
and heuristics on the potential scenarios. 

If the tail candidates stay in long enough I will increase the sophistication.
